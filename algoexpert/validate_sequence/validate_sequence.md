# Validate Sequence

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the secondary array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers <mark style="background-color: lightblue; opacity: 0.4;">[1,3,4]</mark> form a subsequence of the array  <mark style="background-color: lightblue; opacity: 0.4;">[1,2,3,4]</mark>, and so do the numbers <mark style="background-color: lightblue; opacity: 0.4;">[2, 4]</mark>. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

## Sample Input

<pre>
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
</pre>

## Sample Output
<pre>
true
</pre>
